# NOTARY_the_Discovery_of_Book

-Individual Project
I developed a web platform where user can read any book free of cost. All those book's names are mentioned in right hand side of the website.
This website automatically shows the names and the number of "Most Used Words", "Least Used Words" and "Document stats".

In DOCUMENT STATS
used will get Document Count and Word Length.



User can also search the occurance of any word.
